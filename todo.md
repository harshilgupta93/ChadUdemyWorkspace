Create a lib folder in the JAVA project.
download jar files for spring framework and commonlogging 

For Spring JARs:
http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/


For Common logging JARs:
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/download_logging.cgi

The lib folder is also uploaded by me in this project.
You need to add the JAR files into the build path, as shown here
